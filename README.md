# DBA Training - Database Learning Projects

This repository contains organized learning materials and projects for different database systems.

## Structure

Each database directory follows the same organizational structure:

```
<database>/
├── topics/        # Topic-by-topic learning materials
├── exercises/     # Practice exercises and drills
├── projects/      # Real-world projects and implementations
├── notes/         # Personal notes and documentation
└── scripts/       # SQL queries, scripts, and code snippets
```

## Databases

- **MariaDB** - Open-source relational database
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database

4. **Notes** - Keep your personal notes, summaries, and reference materials.
5. **Scripts** - Store reusable queries, setup scripts, and code snippets.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the database you want to learn and start with the `topics/` directory, then move to `exercises/` for practice, and finally work on `projects/` to build something real.
