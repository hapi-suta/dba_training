# Redis Learning

This directory contains learning materials, exercises, and projects for Redis.

## Directory Structure

- **topics/** - Topic-by-topic learning materials
  - Create folders for each topic (e.g., `01-basics/`, `02-data-structures/`, `03-pubsub/`)
  
- **exercises/** - Practice exercises
  - Number your exercises (e.g., `exercise-01.md`, `exercise-02.md`)
  - Include solutions in separate files if needed
  
- **projects/** - Real-world projects
  - Each project gets its own folder with documentation and scripts
  
- **notes/** - Personal notes and reference materials
  - Keep summaries, cheat sheets, and important concepts here
